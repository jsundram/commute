commute
=======
* Use [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) to scrape estimated travel time from google maps.
* Use run.py to run the scraper
* Use parse.py to parse and plot the resulting data. (You'll need at least few days worth of data for a good plot). 
* There are a bunch of dependencies, have fun.
